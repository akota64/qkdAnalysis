# QKD Analysis


In this project, we analyze the typical BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution, how it is affected by noise and interception, and how these can be corrected relatively well by certain error elimination and privacy amplification protocols. Please see the report for more information.

The code for this project was done by Thomas Chamberlin and Akhil Kota. The report was put together by Thomas Chaberlin, Joe Forys and Akhil Kota.
